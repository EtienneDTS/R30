## Update Your Code

If you have made changes to the repository, you'll need to regularly update your local copy of the code. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Make sure you're in your project directory

2. To fetch the latest changes from the remote repository, execute the following command:

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

This will automatically merge the changes from the remote repository into your local copy.

1. If conflicts arise during the merge, Git will prompt you to resolve them manually. You can use a code editor or a Git interface to make these changes.

2. Once you've retrieved the changes and resolved any conflicts, you can continue working on your project using the new data.

3. When you're ready to push your local changes to the remote repository, you can use the git push command.
